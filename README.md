# Financial Ratio Analysis & Apriori Rule Mining

This project analyzes the financial health and performance patterns of five major companies—Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Costco (COST), Federal Signal (FSS), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)—using data sourced from the SEC’s EDGAR API. It uses Python to fetch annual 10-K filings and extract key financial metrics such as revenue, net income, total assets, liabilities, current assets, and inventory. From these raw values, the script calculates several important financial ratios including net profit margin, current ratio, quick ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and return on equity (ROE). These ratios are then normalized using MinMaxScaler and transformed into binary “high” or “low” features to prepare for association rule mining.

The Apriori algorithm is applied to each company’s data to uncover strong and reliable patterns between these financial metrics—such as whether high profit margins consistently lead to high ROE or if strong liquidity is usually tied to lower leverage. Each rule is evaluated based on support, confidence, and lift, and the strongest associations are plotted in a bar chart to easily interpret the results. In addition to the charts, this repository includes a detailed PDF report titled "Comprehensive Analysis Using yfinance" that summarizes the financial trends, explains each ratio’s behavior over time, and interprets the Apriori patterns discovered.

This project is useful for retail investors, business analysts, or finance students looking to explore how common financial indicators interact with one another. It demonstrates that ratios like current and quick move together, that low debt often aligns with higher liquidity, and that companies with high profit margins tend to generate better shareholder returns. The code is written in Python using libraries like pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and mlxtend, and is designed to be easily run in a local environment. All you need is to install the required packages, run the script, and the analysis along with visualizations will be displayed for each company.
